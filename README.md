# Classify-Radio-Signals-from-Outer-Space-using-Keras
Classifying radio signals using Keras library

The Goal of this project is How we can treat the __Time Series Forecast__ problems such as __Signal Processing__ & Transform them to image classification problem & then solve them using __CNNs__ [__Keras__] insted of using __Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).__

## Objectives:
    - Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras
    - Display results and plot 2D spectrograms with Python in Jupyter Notebook

## __SETI Dataset__
I have used SETI dataset for my Convolution Neural Network training and testing for time series forecasting.

## Architechture
- Designed a convolutional neural network with 2 convolution layers and 1 fully connected layers to predict four signal types.
- Used Adam as the optimizer, categorical crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
